# Project Titanic: [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
---

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this project, you will exercise your skills with loading data, python data structures, and Pandas to identify charactaristics of Titanic survivors!

#### Project goals:
* Practice python programming including loops, conditionals, types, functions, and data structures
* Start thinking critically about manipulating, organizing, and interpreting data
* Troubleshoot errors

### Considerations:

* You will be generating long data strutures- avoid displaying the whole thing. Display just the first or last few entries and look at the length or shape to check whether your code gives you back what you want and expect.
* Make functions whenever possiblle!
* Be explicit with your naming. You may forget what `this_list` is, but you will have an idea of what `passenger_fare_list` is. Variable naming will help you in the long run!
* Do not include errors or stack traces (fix them!)
